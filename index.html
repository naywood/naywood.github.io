                <p id= hello> Hello!</p>
                
                <p>  
                I've been given 1,000 nicknames, but you can call me Naomi [nay-oh-me]. I grew up on my family's land in West Texas where we kept goats, chickens and the occasional visit from the emu that lived down the road. Texas is my native home, but I've lived in the PNW for 17 years. I think Seattle will continue to be my primary home but I like the prospect of being a digital nomad.<br><br>
                
                 I like to make things: hollandaise sauce, travel plans, zines, hand-bound photobooks...to name a few. I took a C# class as an elective at Bellevue College; it was there I discovered the rush associated with FINALLY being able to get your code to run correctly. This eventually lead to my enrollment in the full-stack program. After I learn how to learn to code, I'd like to work my way into the specialty of data visualization. <br>
