        <p  id= "about2">I am an ex-certified nursing assistant/artschool dropout trying to learn the skills to build interactive data visualization applications. 
        To be honest, I'm not 100% what that means yet...In this crazy world where we don't have control, I enjoy creating things. One of my biggest distractions is too many ideas and not enough time/know how to put them into motion. 
        I love dogs and I'd like to think that everyday I am one step closer to getting a furbaby of my own.</p>
